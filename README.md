## Installation ##

The main ranked-tiling code is supposed to be used as a module. You can write "config.ini" file that will be used for each telescope using the write_config_file.py code with the following arguments:


  (*)  --work      : The name of the working directory. The configuration script will be created here.
  
  (*) --telescope : The name of the telescope. Currently **ATLAS, BlackGEM, Pan Starrs and ZTF** are the standard telescopes. If the user uses one of these names, then the script uses the existing predefined tile-center files to compute the ranked tiles.
  
  (*) --nside     : This is the resoution of the sky-map that is to be used. Values of nside is in powers of 2. Use values in range of 64 to 2048. The default value is nside=256. If the user uses one of the standard telescopes (see --telescope) in conjunction with the --nside=256 (alternatively doesn't use this option), then the ranked tiling script will be using the existing tile-pixel map (see below for details on this maping) to construct the ranked-tiles. If the user chooses to use a different nside value or uses a non-standard telescope name, then this map needs to be created, which is done by the  script.
  
  (*) --fov       : When the user uses a non-standard telescope, and does not have a predefined telescope tile center file, the --fov option must be used to provide the field-of-view (FOV) of the telescope. The  script will use the value of the FOV to construct an ad-hoc tile center file, which will be used for construction of the tile-pixel maps. If a tile center map is provided (or if a standard telescope is used alongside nside=256) then the use of the --fov option is currently not required. However, this will be made a required quantity in future version. This value will be put into the config file in the work directory.
  
  (*) --tilefile  : Use this option to provide the **full path and name** of the tile center file. This option is required for all cases. If it is used for standard telescopes and nside=256 then the full path and name of the tile center file is put in the config file. Else, this file is first used to compute the tile-pixel map. These maps are put in the tile_pixel_maps directory of the repository and the finally the full path and file name of the tile center file is put in the config file.
                  
  (*) --site      : The site of the observatory. This is required for the "scheduler". Not required for finding ranked-tiles.
                  However, the argument still needs to be supplied (could be just a fake site name).

  (*) --timemag   : This is a file that gives the relationship between integration time and limiting magnitude of the telescope. Ths is not required for finding the ranked tiles. However, the option is a required quantity. One can use None or any dummy name if just the ranked tiles are required to be found. This is required for detectability computation.
                  
  (*) --extension : The file extension (png, pdf etc) of the plot of the tiles. Only required for the plotting method.
                  However, the argument still needs to be supplied (could be just a fake extension name).

Example commands:

python write_config_file.py --work ~/RunDir/sky_tile_work --telescope BlackGEM --site None --timemag None --extension png

python write_config_file.py --work ~/RunDir/sky_tile_work --telescope BlackGEM --site lasilla --timemag None --extension pdf

...
*NOTE: Currently the  script has to be run from the repository itself.*
Running this should generate a config file in the work directory. The std output of the script is the environment variables that will need to be exported. Once that is done, the ranked-tiling methods will be available for use:


## The Ranked-Tiling Strategy ##

**Introduction:**
Follow-up of gravitational wave sky-localization regions using large FOV telescopes requires adopting strategies that cover a desired localization interval with minimum number of telescope pointings. Each pointing leaves a footprint of the telescope field-of-view on the sky. We define this footprint as a tile. In arXiv:1511.02673 we presented a strategy which we named ranked-tiling strategy to optimally cover the GW loclizations. This strategy is most useful when the telescope's FOV is very large and if the telscope opts for a predefined grid to get reference images from earlier epochs. In this strategy we first compute the probability localized within each tile in the predefined grid and then rank the tiles based on the probability values. Take the top 'N' number of tiles from this ranked list that comprises 90% of the GW localization probability, that is the requred set of ranked-tiles. 

For a given telescope with predetermined sky-grid the centers of the allowed footprints are fixed in the sky. This we call the 'fixed-tiles'. For a given resolution of sky-map the pixels of the BAYESTAR sky-map are also known in advnce. Thus set of pixels that are inside a given tile are predetermined. Thus we can construct a tile-pixel map for a given telecope sky-grid and given resolution of sky-map. This can be exploited to construct the ranked-tiles very rapidly, since the probability contained in a given tile is simply computed by querying the probability value in the pixels that are mapped into the tile.


**Tile-Pixel maps:**
A vital ingredient for the ranked tile generation is the tile-pixel map for a telescope. This allows rapid computation of the ranked tiles. Currently the repository contains tile-pixel maps for the four aforementioned telescopes. Only resolution of nside=256 is available for all the telescopes. Higher resolution maps are larger, and we will provide them via other means (currently available in the NEMO cluster of UWM). However, the users are welcome to generate their own tile pixel maps. We describe this below:

If the user defines a telescope that is among the standard telescope name for this repository, namely Atlas, BlackGEM, PS1 and ZTF, then the ranked-tiling code will use the existing pre-computed tile-pixel maps in the utilities directory of the repository. However if a non-standard telescope name is used, then the user has two option:

Option 1.

User can specify a tile center file, which has the center of the predefined sky-grid for the tiles. The format of the tiles is as shown below (no spaces between lines). Examples of such files can be obtained from the tile_center_files directory of the repository.

ID        ra_center         dec_center

0         25.00            -89.9

1         51.43            -88.36

2         102.86           -88.36

3         154.29           -88.36

4         205.71           -88.36

The  command that needs to be run in such a case is:

python write_config_file.py --work ~/RunDir/sky_tile_work --telescope <some telescope> --site <some site or None> --timemag <some time magnitude file or None> --tilefile <name and full path of tile file> --extension png

This will first create the tile-pixel map file and put it in the tile_pixel_maps directory of the repository. Then create the config file in the working directory with the paths to this file in the right section.



Option 2.

If the user do not have such a file, then this file first needs to be generated first. You would need to know the field-of-view (FOV) of the telescope to generate. Note that currently the software can only handle square FOV.

To do this run the  script with the following options:

python write_config_file.py --work ~/RunDir/sky_tile_work --telescope <some telescope> --site <some site or None> --timemag <some time magnitude file or None> --fov <telescope FOV> --extension png

This will prompt the  script to first generate an ad-hoc tile coordinate file that it will put in the tile_center_files directory. It will then use this file to generate the tile-pixel map files that it will put in the tile_pixel_maps directory of the repository. Finally it will create the config file and put in the work directory with the right paths.


Please note that both Option 1 and Option would require construction of the tile-pixel maps and these might take a long amount of time to run depending of the --nside value you use and the FOV of your telescope. By default (if you do not use any --nside option) the resolution used for the construction of the tile-pixel maps is nside=256. 


## Running ranked-tiling codes ##

The basic function call involves creating the ranked-tile object for a given telescope. Once the user has setup for a particular telescope, all that is required is a GW sky-localization from LIGO-Virgo. To test the software, the user needs to import the module rankedTilesGenerator from python and create the ranked-tile object as follows:

tileObj = rankedTilesGenerator.RankedTileGenerator('bayestar.fits.gz', 'config.ini')

where, bayestar.fits.gz is the GW sky-localization map. 

This tile object can then be used to create the ranked tiles as shown below:

[ranked_tile_indices, ranked_tile_probs] = tileObj.getRankedTiles(resolution=256)

This generates the ranked tiles and their corresponding probability values.

[Remember, to generate ranked tiles with higher resolution (unnecessary for large FOV telescopes like ZTF, Atlas or PS1), you will need to have the corresponding tile-pixel map files, which are not present in the repository. However, if you are interested to produce them, then just use a non-standard telescope name while running  script and give the tile center file. The script will generate the tile-pixel map files].



To plot the tiles use the following method:
rankedTileData = tileObj.plotTiles(ranked_tile_indices, ranked_tile_probs, CI=0.90, FOV=47.3, tileEdges=True, save=True)


This will plot the top ranked-tiles containing the 90% localization probability. Keeping save=True will save the resulting plot in a file with the extension that the user defined while running setup script (by using the --extension option). If this save=False is used, the plot will not be saved, instead will be displayed to the user. The result of this method call is an astropy table (rankedTileData)

Rank	index	RA			Dec			Probability

1		691		24.71429	-85.93846	0.122820301363

2		733		76.14286	-85.93846	0.112929047613

3		644		127.57143	-85.93846	0.10439656724

...	

Where, the details of the 90% tiles are saved. The RA and the Dec are the location of the tile centers. The is the tile ID from the tile center file and the probability is the sum total of the probability contained within these tiles.

If tileEdges is set to False then the boundary of the tiles will not be plotted. Only the tile centers will be kept. If FOV is not given, then no tile boundary will be plotted either. 'save' allows the plot to be saved using the extension provided in the config file (generated by the write_config_file script). CI is the confidence interval.



Other methods:


1.  searchedArea: Given a sky-map and the actual injection position, we can find 
                  the total searched area and the searched probability to reach 
                  to the source. The resolution of the sky-map can also be supplied.


2.  sourceTile:   Give the ranked tiles and the actual injection position, this 
                  method finds the source tile index. 
                  
3.  detectability:  Function - given the rank of the source tile, integrtion time 
                    per tile, the total observation time, the distance to the 
                    source and limiting magnitude - time data for the telescope, 
                    this function gives the detectiability of the source
